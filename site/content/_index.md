  text: >-
    Is your IT team delivering solutions that are not adopted by your employees?
    Across the globe, the tech experts are leading a (much needed) digital
    evolution dictated by InfoSec and corporate governance... at the same time,
    your sales, customer service and operations teams are frustrated at the
    software imposed on them, making them frustrated and less efficient in their
    daily tasks.
